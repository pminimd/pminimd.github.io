NeRF is a combination of volume rendering and implicit representation. 

During view synthesis process, we first generate a batch of rays from the view direction. Then, We do integration along each ray to estimate the final color value before it enter our eyes. The function that be integraled we have metioned before is related to the scene's volume density and its' color distribution. What's more, the function are represented by a Neural Network that we called NeRF. Actually, we sampled several nodes on the ray and query the NeRF and added them together to simulate the process of integration.

Two main things can determin the time consumption. One is the time that we query the NeRF, The other is time consuption of each query
